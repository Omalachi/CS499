# 🎓 Malachi Okongwu – CS 499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio

Welcome to my professional ePortfolio for the CS 499 Computer Science Capstone course at Southern New Hampshire University. This portfolio presents enhanced project artifacts that showcase my growth and skills across three core areas of Computer Science: **Software Design & Engineering**, **Algorithms and Data Structures**, and **Databases**.

## 👨🏾‍💻 About Me

My name is **Malachi Okongwu**, a soon-to-be graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My journey has involved building real-world projects and developing a passion for creating clean, maintainable, and user-centered software.

This ePortfolio highlights the culmination of my academic work, demonstrating both technical proficiency and professional readiness. The featured project—a Unity-based **Craps Game Simulation**—has been enhanced to reflect key software engineering principles, well-structured algorithms, and simple data persistence strategies.

## 🧩 Project Overview – Craps Game Simulation (Unity)

The primary artifact featured in this portfolio is a digital simulation of the classic casino **Craps game**, built using the Unity game engine and C#. This project started as a simple dice roller and evolved into a modular, maintainable, and enhanced program that includes:

- 🎲 Randomized dice logic
- 💰 Currency tracking and betting system
- 🎨 Responsive UI with TextMeshPro
- 🔍 Code refactored using object-oriented best practices
- 🗂️ Lightweight data logging for game results

## 📁 Artifact Enhancements by Category

### 💻 Software Design & Engineering

The original `DiceRoller` script was refactored into multiple components:

- `MainController` – Coordinates all game components
- `GameManager` – Handles game state and currency logic
- `DiceManager` – Manages dice values and rolls
- `UIManager` – Updates UI elements like bet and currency
- `ChipManager` – Displays chip denominations
- `DataManager` – Logs roll results to a simple file

> This demonstrates separation of concerns, modular design, and maintainability.

### 📊 Algorithms and Data Structures

The game’s core logic uses conditionals and randomized values to simulate:

- Dice roll results
- Betting outcomes (win/loss conditions)
- Looping structures for dynamic chip value calculation

> Enhancements include improved dice roll structure, encapsulated condition checks, and cleaner modular function design.

---

### 🗃️ Databases (Lightweight File Logging)

To simulate data persistence, I implemented a simple file-based logging system in Unity:

- Logs include dice rolls, outcome (win/loss), and bet amount
- Stored in a local `.txt` file using `System.IO`

> This provides a basic yet effective way to record and analyze results. It meets the project requirement while remaining simple and accessible to newer developers.
